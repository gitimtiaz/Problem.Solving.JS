**JavaScript Basics Practice**

This repository contains five beginner-friendly JavaScript problems focused on building core programming fundamentals such as functions, loops, strings, arrays, and basic logic. Each task is implemented in a simple and readable way.




**1. Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter**

This task converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a mathematical formula.
It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and function usage.
The solution also handles string inputs and formats the output properly.

**2. Count Repeated Number in an Array**

This task counts how many times a specific number appears in an array.
It focuses on array traversal and conditional logic.
String values are safely converted to numbers before comparison.

**3. Count Vowels in a String**

This task counts the total number of vowels in a given string.
Multiple approaches are explored, including loops and regular expressions.
Both uppercase and lowercase vowels are handled correctly.

**4. Find the Longest Word in a String**

This task identifies the longest word from a sentence.
It demonstrates string splitting, iteration, and comparison logic.
An improved version also removes punctuation before processing.

**5. Generate a Random Number (10–20)**

This task generates a random number between 10 and 20 (inclusive).
It uses JavaScript’s built-in Math.random() method.
The solution ensures correct range handling without off-by-one errors.
